# portableRemapper
A portable tool that can be run without UAC escalation and remaps your keyboard layout temporarily. At the moment this program only supports Windows and you can only use the Colemak layout. I do plan to add support for more layouts in the future. If you find any errors you can contact me on discord here tap#0061.

## Usage
Run the compiled binary and the tool should start converting your qwerty keystrokes to Colemak (Note: This tool doesn't update caps lock to be delete). When you want to return to normal just close the program. It's important to note that I don't believe this will work on escalated software like powershell, but if you can run escalated software you can run the normal Colemak installer ;) (Note: Since this code is interacting with a LL keyboard hook it may trigger your Anti-Virus software because it thinks its a keylogger.)
